- Please see the [_main_ branch](https://github.com/hamrel-cxu/EnbPI/tree/main) on how the code should be used and what are included in the ICML conference version
- **Difference from earlier**
  - Include [tests_simulation_journal.py](https://github.com/hamrel-cxu/EnbPI/blob/JMLR_code/tests_simulation_journal.py)
  - Delete test_paper.py, with [tests_paper+supp_journal.py](https://github.com/hamrel-cxu/EnbPI/blob/JMLR_code/tests_paper%2Bsupp_journal.py) containing everything to reproduce real-data results in the main text and in the appendix
  - Delete PI_class_ECAD.py, with [utils_ECAD_journal.py](https://github.com/hamrel-cxu/EnbPI/blob/JMLR_code/utils_ECAD_journal.py) containing all the functionalities.
